3.1 Three in One

Can be generalized to N Stacks 

consider special case, N = 1

s = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0];
capacity is size of array 
ptr = 0;

when we push to stack, then we just increment and set to new value
when we pop from stack, we decrement if curr ptr is 0, and then set to 0;

N = 2
s = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
two ptrs: one in front, other at the end

N = 3
s = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]

Use array
